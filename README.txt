Autolink Filter for Drupal 7
----------------------------
 Allows AJAXified search for user and node names.

 Typing a @ will show an <input> in place, and initiates a search of users and nodes. 
 The user can select an autocomplete option, which is converted to a link on display.
 Allows spaces in user names or titles. Intended for use with HTML inputs.

 Degrades to simple server side link creation if there is no JavaScript support.
